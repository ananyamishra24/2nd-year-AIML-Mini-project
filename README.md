## 🧠 How It Works

1. Parent fills in child's **name, age, gender, medical condition, and personality traits**
2. **Gemini 2.5 Flash** generates a 3-page personalized story with the child as the hero
3. **DALL-E 3** generates a vivid illustration for each page
4. Story is saved to SQLite and displayed in the interactive viewer
5. Parent can **narrate, translate, favorite, or delete** the story anytime
